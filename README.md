# Convert .gif to Teams Background
This tool allows you to add .gif files as backgrounds in Microsoft Teams. It was originally created to add memes as backgrounds for internal meetings at my company. However, as the tool gained popularity, someone forgot to change the settings in a customer meeting, leading the company to ban any backgrounds other than the ones provided by the company.

To share this tool with the community, I am releasing it here, along with some example .gif files in 'Examples'.

## Usage
To use the tool, you simply need to Drag&Drop your .gif onto the "ConvertGifToTeamsBackground.exe".
The tool will do the rest. 

Error explanations:
"The Teams path seems to not exist. Please make sure it exists: X"
=>	The Tool could not find the new Teams path. Make sure you have used the new Teams at least once.

"Given path X does not exist"
=>	Something seems to be not correct about the Image you dropped onto it.
	Normally, the tool extracts the path from the file you have dragged onto it.
	Either you didn't drag a file onto the .exe or your file is corrupt.

"The file given is not a .gif, it is a X."
=>	The file you have dragged onto it does not appear to be a .gif file.

"Something went wrong while copying the .gif to the right location. Copied to: X"
=>	Something seems to have gone wrong. This error occurs when checking whether the file is in the correct location. 
	One possible cause could be a lack of access rights.
