# Convert .gif to Teams Background
This tool allows you to add .gif files as backgrounds in Microsoft Teams. It was originally created to add memes as backgrounds for internal meetings at my company. However, as the tool gained popularity, someone forgot to change the settings in a customer meeting, leading the company to ban any backgrounds other than the ones provided by the company.

To share this tool with the community, I am releasing it here, along with some example .gif files in 'Examples'.
